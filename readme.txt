This will be my first project I will be working on to practice using git. I will be using existing logic written by others (PID control) and some more specific to my espresso machine.

Functions I will need:
  PID control **depending on added pressure sensor**
  WiFi control/status
  Relay operation
  Motor speed control (0-5V signal)
  Autofill logic
  Remote power/auto-on scheduling
